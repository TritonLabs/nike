# Nike — Navigate Crypto

> Use nike.wagmify.me for now, we're porting domains.

The tool makes it faster to navigate to common crypto sites — instead of going to CoinGeiko.com and searching for olympus, you can just type in `p ohm` and the tool will automatically redirect you.

The tool is built with JS and **runs purely locally in the browser** so there are no securty implications about sending search results to an unknown server. 


## Example Commands

Command | Example | Description
--- | --- | ---
p, price | p olympus | Opens CoinGeiko dashboard for the spelled out coin.
tx | tx 0x000.. or tx 1123123 for SOL | Opens Etherscan or Solscan depending on the hash type.
w, wallet | w vitalik.eth | Opens the walllet based on the hash or the ENS name.
